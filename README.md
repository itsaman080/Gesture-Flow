# Gesture-Flow
Description
GestureFlow is an innovative project that leverages hand gestures to control and interact with digital content. Utilizing computer vision techniques, the application tracks hand movements captured by a webcam and translates them into various actions, such as drawing on a canvas or controlling applications. This real-time interaction is made possible through the integration of the Mediapipe framework for hand gesture recognition.


Features
Hand Gesture Recognition: Employs the Mediapipe framework for accurate hand tracking and gesture recognition.
Real-time Interaction: Provides immediate response to hand movements for a seamless user experience.
Multi-color Support: Allows users to draw with multiple colors on the canvas.
Drawing Modes: Offers various drawing modes for different types of interactions.
Clear Canvas: Includes a clear button to reset the canvas easily.
User-friendly Setup: Simple installation and usage instructions for quick deployment.
Tech Stack
Python: The core programming language used for developing the application.
OpenCV: Utilized for computer vision tasks such as capturing and processing video from the webcam.
Mediapipe: Framework used for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
NumPy: Supports numerical operations required for processing hand gestures.
