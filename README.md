<h1 align="center" id="title">Gesture Flow</h1>

<p id="description">Gesture Flow is an innovative project that leverages hand gestures to control and interact with digital content. Utilizing computer vision techniques the application tracks hand movements captured by a webcam and translates them into various actions such as drawing on a canvas or controlling applications. This real-time interaction is made possible through the integration of the Mediapipe framework for hand gesture recognition.</p>

  
  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Hand Gesture Recognition: Employs the Mediapipe framework for accurate hand tracking and gesture recognition.
*   Real-time Interaction: Provides immediate response to hand movements for a seamless user experience.
*   Multi-color Support: Allows users to draw with multiple colors on the canvas.
*   Drawing Modes: Offers various drawing modes for different types of interactions.
*   Clear Canvas: Includes a clear button to reset the canvas easily.
*   User-friendly Setup: Simple installation and usage instructions for quick deployment.
